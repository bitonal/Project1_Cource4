Course-end Project 1
DESCRIPTION
Build an ASP.NET website comprising of the following three pages:
•	Pizza selection page 
•	Order checkout page
•	Order confirmation page 
Create test suites to test the pages for end-user testing. 
Background of the problem statement:
Joe’s Pizza has created the UI for an online ordering portal. They want the pages to be properly tested with a testing framework using NUnit, Selenium and Specflow. The prototype will then be deployed via Jenkins to an Azure VM at scheduled intervals.
You must use the following:
•	Visual Studio ASP.NET Core Project
•	NUnit 
•	Selenium
•	SpecFlow
•	Jenkins
•	Windows Azure
You have been hired to perform the following tasks:
•	Create an ASP.NET Core web application containing three cshtml pages:
•	A Pizza selection page which will allow users to choose which type of pizza they want to order.
•	An Order Checkout page which will show the selected pizza with quantity and pricing. Clicking on Checkout will take them to the confirmation page.
•	Order Confirmation page which will display a message with an order id, amount and the type of pizza that is ordered.
•	Create a Windows Class Library project.
•	Add a project reference to the first project.
•	Configure NUnit, Selenium and Specflow.
•	Write test cases to test the web app.
•	Run the test cases using Test Runner.
•	Create an Azure VM for hosting the prototype app.
•	Set up Jenkins to create a build at scheduled intervals in the day and deploy it to Azure.
